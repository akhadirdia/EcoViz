Application Description: ECOVIZ  (https://abdou.shinyapps.io/Ecoviz/)
This web application, named ECOVIZ, is an interactive platform for visualizing and analyzing environmental data, focusing primarily on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water quality, and exotic aquatic fauna in Quebec.

Key Features:
GHG Emissions Tracking:

Interactive Graph:
Displays the evolution of GHG emissions by region (e.g., Estrie, Mauricie) over a selected period.
Users can choose one or multiple regions for comparison.
Helps monitor regional environmental trends and assess efforts to reduce GHG emissions.
Water Quality:

Interactive Map:
Shows water quality across different regions of Quebec.
Quality is categorized on a scale (Excellent, Good, Fair, Marginal, Poor) and represented with color codes.
Enables decision-makers and researchers to identify areas requiring improvement.

Contaminant Emissions:

Annual Visualization:
Displays total emissions of contaminants in tons for a selected year.
Star Diagram:
Breaks down emissions by region for specific regional analysis.

Exotic Aquatic Fauna:

Regional Analysis:
Allows users to select a region (e.g., Bas-Saint-Laurent) to study the exotic aquatic fauna present.
Donut Chart:
Shows the distribution of exotic species (fish, mollusks, crustaceans, reptiles) by type and quantity.
Helps identify invasive species and understand their distribution.

Target Audience:
Government and municipal institutions: To monitor environmental management efforts.
Researchers and academics: To access regional environmental data and analyze trends.
Citizens and NGOs: To raise awareness about environmental impacts in their region.
This visually rich and intuitive platform facilitates understanding of environmental issues and supports informed decision-making for sustainable management.
